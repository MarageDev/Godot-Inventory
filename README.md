    An attempt at creating a simple and modular inventory system in Godot 
  </h3>
  <h6>WIP</h6>

# Description
This is an inventory system I'm building mainly for my game Dead By Gun Smoke but I'm making it modular as my goal is to make it easy to use 
for many things with inventory-like interactions by exposing most of the main actions so it's possible to build your own logic without being restrcited to the general inventory one.
> ***Note :*** I still need to put it as a plugin. Feel free to check it tho and see how it is.
# Features
- ***Drag*** and ***drop***
- ***Stack splitting*** : CTRL + Left click x times to select x items to move
- ***Quick switch*** from one inventory to another : SHIFT + Left click ( not added yet )
- ***Auto sorting*** ( depending on custom sorting parameters )
- A lot of ***information exposed through signals*** for an easier integration
- An ***example scene*** to showcase a common inventory layout with mechanics
- Items are managed as ***`Resources`*** for an easier maintainability, saving and loading in general
