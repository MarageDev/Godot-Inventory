    An attempt at creating a simple and modular inventory system in Godot

# Description
This is an inventory system I'm building mainly for my game Dead By Gun Smoke but I'm making it modular as my goal is to make it easy to use 
for many things with inventory-like interactions by exposing most of the main actions so it's possible to build your own logic without being restrcited to the general inventory one.
> ***Note :*** As of now, the project is really messy and not worth using until I put it as a plugin. Feel free to check it tho and see how it is.
